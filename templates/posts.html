            <div class="card-body">Java is a popular programming language.

                Java is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and much more.
                If you do not have Java installed on your computer, you can download it for free at oracle.com.

                Note: In this tutorial, we will write Java code in a text editor. However, it is possible to write Java
                in an Integrated Development Environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Netbeans or Eclipse, which are
                particularly useful when managing larger collections of Java files.</div>

            <div class="card-header">How to learn Python?</div>
            <div class="card-body">Python is a popular programming language.

                Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
                The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However,
                Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
                In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an
                Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly
                useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</div>
